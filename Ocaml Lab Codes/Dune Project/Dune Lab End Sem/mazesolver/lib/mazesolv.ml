(** [solvemaze maze (entryrow, entrycol)] tries to find an exit point
    starting from the entry point to the maze (which is a 2D matrix of
    0s and 1s) indicated by the cell [(entryrow, entrycol)], i.e.,
    [maze.(entryrow).(entrycol)].

    If no exit point is found, it returns [None], otherwise it returns
    [Some x] where [x] is a tuple indicating the found exit point. 

    If entry point provided is invalid (the cell is not open, i.e.,
    it's value is not 0), then it fails with [failwith "Invalid Entry
    Point"] *)

(** [get_parameters ()] reads the 3 parameters which the user is

    the maze in the required format, the second and third arguments
    are supposed to be the row and column number for the entry point
    to the maze. Thus, the return type for this function is:
    [(string*int*int)]

    In case any argument is/are missing, or extra arguments are
    provided, it prints a usage message and exits with a [Failure
    "Wrong Input"] exception *)

    [row], [col] pair obtained from [get_parameters] to call
    [mat_of_file] function in the [readmaze.ml] file to read the
    matrix from the provided file, and the [solvemaze] function with
    the appropriate parameters to find the exit point.

    If no exit point is found, it prints an appropriate one line
    message. If a solution is found, it prints an appropriate message
    with the row column pair for the exit point found. *)
