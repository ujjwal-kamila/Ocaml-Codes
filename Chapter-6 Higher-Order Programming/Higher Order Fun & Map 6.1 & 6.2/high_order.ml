(* Double & square functions *)
let double x = 2 * x;;
double 4;;
let square x = x * x;;
square 4;;

(*Letâ€™s use these functions to write other functions that quadruple and raise a number to the fourth power: *)
(* Define a function 'quad' to quadruple a number *)
let quad x = double (double x);; (*x = x*4 *)
quad 3;;
quad 1;;

(* Define a function 'fourth' to raise a number to the fourth power *)
let fourth x = square (square x);;
fourth 2;;

(*implement the twice fun from upper*)
let twice f x = f (f x);;
twice quad 1;;  (*quad 1= 4 .... twice 4 = 4*4 *)
twice square 2;; (*ans:16,as squares 2 twice: 2*2*2*2.*)

(* quad computes the quadruple of its input by using twice with double. *)
let quad x = twice double x;;
quad 1;;
quad 2;;
(* fourth computes the fourth power of its input by using twice with square. *)
let fourth x = twice square x;;
fourth 1;;
fourth 3;;


(* 6.1.1 The Abstraction Principle *)
(* We can write a function that applies its first input to its second input: *)
let apply f x = f x
